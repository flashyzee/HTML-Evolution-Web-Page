    <img src = "https://static3.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HTML-Effects-Featured.jpg">
    <p>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and it is the standard language that is used to produce various webpages and applications like this one!</p>

<p> For this assignment, I would be listing 10  highlights for HTML evolution.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>HTML 1.0: According to Medium, this was the first version of HTML that was used from 1989 to 1994 and it was a limited verion that had only 20 elements. </li>
        <li>HTML 2.0: The HTML 2.0 version was made in 1995, and it had significant improvement to HTML 1.0. This new version enabled changing of a page background, text colour, text face, and the use of tables and text boxes etc.</li>
        <li>HTML 2.0 becomes the first official set of standards for HTML - the base standard by which all browsers were measured until HTML 3.2." (Bartels, 2011).</li>
        <li> After HTML 2.0 was created, it was around the same time the (World Wide Web Consortium) was created - it is an organisation that develops web standards.</li>
        <li> Furthermore, after HTML 2.0 was created, people wanted to have more funtionality with HTML."Netscape Navigator", became the leading browser and they began to introduce newer abilities called "Netscape extension tags".</li>
        <li>HTML 3.2: The HTML 3.2 was created on January, 1997, and it was endorsed by the W3 Consortium and it was also approved by the likes of Netscape, and Microsoft.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, the HTML 3.2 version included tablets, applets, text flow around images, subscripts, and superscripts." (W3.org, 1998).</li>
        <li>HTML 4.01: This version of HTML got created in 1999, and it included cascading style sheets (css) which enabled features like texts, colour, font, and backgrounds to be easily altered.</li>
        <li>HTML 5: HTML 5 is the most current version of HTML and it can be used to write web applications that can still work even if you're not connected to the net.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, HTML 5 is considered to be a evolving language and it is supported by all of the biggest browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet.</li>
        

    </ul>
